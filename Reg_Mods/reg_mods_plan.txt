## Regression Models Course Project ##

You work for Motor Trend, a magazine about the automobile industry. Looking at a data set of a collection of
cars, they are interested in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG)
(outcome). They are particularly interested in the following two questions:

# Aims:
1) "Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG"
2) "Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions"

# Check List:
	RMarkdown document output to a PDF file
	Main analysis - 2 pages
	Appendix inc code and graphs - 3 pages
	=> Total number of pages = 5
	Opening executive summary paragraph

# Points in peer assessment
	Interpret Coefficient correctly => fit of a linear model and what the expected values mean
	Do some exploratory data analysis => at start look at structure of data and any general patterns, some quick plots
	Fit multiple models and explain reasons behind model selection => standard fit, mean centring fit, no intercept?
	Conclusions - answering questions of interest (of why not answerable)
	Residual plot and diagnostics - to show how well the models fit the data
	Quantify uncertainty in models and perform an inference
-------------------------

# Plan
	1) import data set, subset into required data - turn transmission data into a factor (as it's discrete data)
		> Predictor/Regressor(X) = Transmission / Outcome(Y) = MPG
	2) basic exploratory data analysis to see what it looks like and possible trends
		> conditional plot of facet plot???
	3) fit linear models
		> research when to include or not include an intercept
			> probably not in this case as the predictor is discrete and cannot be zero.
		> with intercept & slope
		> with slope only
		> mean centring (with or without intercept?)
