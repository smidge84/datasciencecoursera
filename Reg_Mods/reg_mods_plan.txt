## Regression Models Course Project ##

You work for Motor Trend, a magazine about the automobile industry. Looking at a data set of a collection of
cars, they are interested in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG)
(outcome). They are particularly interested in the following two questions:

# Aims:
1) "Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG"
2) "Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions"

# Check List:
	RMarkdown document output to a PDF file
	Main analysis - 2 pages
	Appendix inc code and graphs - 3 pages
	=> Total number of pages = 5
	Opening executive summary paragraph

# Points in peer assessment
	Interpret Coefficient correctly => fit of a linear model and what the expected values mean
	Do some exploratory data analysis => at start look at structure of data and any general patterns, some quick plots
	Fit multiple models and explain reasons behind model selection => standard fit, mean centring fit, no intercept?
		> might not be models above, more like a model mpg ~ am, or mpg ~ multiple variables (am, wt, gears, cyl etc.)
		> how to choose which variables? Which have strongest affect on mpg (not explained by other variables)?
		> see week lectures
	Conclusions - answering questions of interest (of why not answerable)
	Residual plot and diagnostics - to show how well the models fit the data
	Quantify uncertainty in models and perform an inference
-------------------------

# Plan
	0) aim to follow the analysis structure performed in the lecture examples
	1) import data set, subset into required data - turn transmission data into a factor (as it's discrete data)
		> Predictor/Regressor(X) = Transmission / Outcome(Y) = MPG
	2) basic exploratory data analysis to see what it looks like and possible trends
		> conditional plot or facet plot???
		> matrix of correlations of MPG against other variables. This can help show which variables have the strongest affect MPG.
	3) fit linear models
		> research when to include or not include an intercept
			> The intercept is okay in this case because it is the mean(automatic) MPG.
		> with intercept & slope
		> with slope only
		> mean centring (with or without intercept?)
		> multiple models include a single variable and multiple variables
		> how to choose the multiple variables to include? Week 3 lectures?

Hypothesis testing:
T-test of two (unpaired) groups can show that mpg & am are significantly different from each other.
because the t confidence interval does not include zero, we reject the null hypothesis that they are related

Multivariate Linear Regression Models.
Function to assess and choose best combination of all possible variables?
Use a plot of residuals to illustrate this is a good choice. and R squared result (quantifies proportion of variation explained by the model)???
